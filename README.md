### Description

A generic Fortran repository that contains various exercises. This repository serves as a collection of Fortran programs that can be used as a resource for learning and practicing the language. The exercises cover a range of topics, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts such as numerical methods and scientific computing. Each exercise is contained within its own directory and includes a brief description of the problem being solved, along with the source code and any necessary input or output files. The repository may also include sample solutions for each exercise to help users check their own solutions or learn from different approaches. The goal of the repository is to provide a valuable resource for Fortran programmers of all levels to improve their skills and knowledge.

##### mkdir.f95

- This code is written in Fortran and creates a new directory using the system command 'mkdir'. The program starts by reading a character string input from the user and storing it in the variable 'pasta'. The code then sets the 'path' variable to a default value of '/home/estudante/' and the 'folder' variable to the user input. The 'makedirectory' variable is then created by concatenating the 'mkdir' command with the 'path' and 'folder' variables using the '//' operator.
Finally, the 'makedirectory' string is printed to the console and the 'system' function is called with the 'makedirectory' string as the argument to execute the 'mkdir' command and create the new directory.
